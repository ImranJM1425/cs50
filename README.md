My CS50 Journey

This is my journey to learning how to be a developer with Harvard's CS50 course. My first course will be the python course,
followed by the main CS50 course. I am doing a mid career switch from biomedical science into the world of programming.
This is because it is extremely competitive to get a job in the country where I'm in (Singapore), in the biomedical field.
I've been jobless for 6-7 months and with me being the sole breadwinner of my family, I decided to take the plunge and
restart my career on a new path.
